# SQL Server unit testing with tSQLt, Docker and GitHub Actions 

This repository contains the demos of the session "SQL Server unit testing with tSQLt, Docker and GitHub Actions" that I have done at the [SQL Start 2024](https://sessionize.com/api/v2/9ln10zam/view/GridSmart) event!

## Run this sample

You can repeat the demo in your own GitHub repository by following the steps described in [this guide](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/blob/master/samples/containers/unit-testing/tsqlt-docker/README.md) on [microsoft/sql-server-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples).

## Summary

The unit tests developed to test SQL Server objects are not only intended to verify that the requirements have been met once, before release; the real game changer is represented by the possibility of repeating checks during the development of new code and bug fixing. The repeatability of tests provides the possibility of automating them, an essential condition for integrating automatic tests within a Continuous Integration platform. In this session, full of demos, we will describe how to automate the testing of one or more SQL Server objects using tSQLt, Docker, and GitHub Action!

Have fun with SQL Server, tSQLt, Docker and GitHub Actions!
